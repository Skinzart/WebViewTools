# WebViewTools

This is a Java extension for App Inventor based platforms. This extension provides access to a number of methods for the WebViewer component which are not available in App Inventor itself.

Now in version 5 the extension is able to handle popups which are usually needed in OAuth login flow. Popups are especially important in OAuth login used in a lot of websites (e.g., www.feedly.com). The popups in this project opened in a dialog and can be dismissed by a close button or pressing Back or if the popup window closes itself (like what happens on most login authentication flow).
